SQL analysis of hospital management data

# Hospital SQL Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a synthetic hospital management dataset using SQL to explore patient utilization, doctor workload, treatment costs, billing behavior, and insurance performance.

## Objectives
- Analyze patient visit patterns and appointment outcomes
- Evaluate doctor workload and specialization demand
- Identify high-cost treatments and cost trends
- Examine billing status and payment behavior
- Assess insurance usage and pending payment risk

## Tools
- PostgreSQL, DBeaver
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions)
- Tableau (for visualization)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple tables simulating a hospital management system from Kaggle.com:
- patients
- doctors
- appointments
- treatments
- billing

All data is synthetically generated for educational purposes.

## Key Insights
- Patient visits fluctuate monthly with a notable proportion of non-completed appointments.
- Doctor workload varies significantly across specializations.
- A small number of treatment types contribute disproportionately to total treatment costs.
- Insurance payments exhibit higher pending rates compared to direct payment methods.

## Next Steps
- Build interactive dashboards using Tableau
